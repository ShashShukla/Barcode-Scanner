# Barcode-Scanner

This repository contains code and the final presentation and report for the Electronic Design Lab, IIT Bombay 2018.

We constructed a low-cost barcode scanner using cheap parts from an optical disk drive with a linear-scan scan design and no expensive optical parts. We used our scanner to successfully decode UPC-E barcodes on an Arduino microcontroller.
